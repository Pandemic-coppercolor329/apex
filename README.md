# Apex

**Apex** updates every package manager on your system in parallel — safely — so you spend less time waiting and more time doing something else.

It's built for Arch setups (pacman + AUR + flatpak + snap), but also understands apt (Debian/Ubuntu) and dnf (Fedora/RHEL), and doesn't assume they're mutually exclusive with pacman — so it works fine in containers, WSL, or any oddly-layered setup where more than one shows up.

```
$ ./apex.sh
== Downloading system package updates (pacman, one at a time) ==
[✓] pacman downloads finished in 0m42s

== Starting installs + AUR update in the background ==
[✓] AUR build phase reached — starting flatpak/snap now while it keeps building.

== flatpak, then snap ==
[✓] flatpak updated in 0m18s
[✓] snap updated in 0m09s

== Summary ==
[✓] Everything updated successfully.

Time without parallelization (sum of every step run back-to-back): 4m37s
Time with parallelization    (actual wall-clock time taken):       2m51s
Saved: 1m46s (38%)
```

The percentage you'll actually see depends heavily on your machine and what needs updating (a system with a big AUR compile queue benefits far more than one with only a couple of flatpak updates) — but in typical mixed pacman+AUR+flatpak+snap runs, **30–45% less total time** is a reasonable expectation. The savings scale with how much CPU-bound work (installs, AUR builds) you have relative to network-bound work.

## Why

If you run more than one package format — pacman + AUR + flatpak + snap is a common combo on Arch-based distros — the naive way to update everything is to run each updater one after another. Most of that time is wasted: downloads sit idle while a previous manager is busy installing, and installs/builds sit idle while nothing is downloading.

Apex's only real trick: **downloads are the one resource that's actually shared and scarce** (your bandwidth). Installing, building, and unpacking are disk/CPU work and don't compete with downloads at all. So Apex keeps every *download* step serialized against every other download step, but lets *install/build* steps run fully in parallel with each other and with the next thing's downloads.

## Installation

Apex is a single self-contained bash script. No dependencies beyond what's already on your system (`bash`, `coreutils` — specifically `stdbuf`, `sudo`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EduLGFon/apex.git
cd apex
chmod +x apex.sh
```

Run it directly:

```bash
./apex.sh
```

Or drop it somewhere on your `$PATH` for convenience:

```bash
sudo cp apex.sh /usr/local/bin/apex
apex
```

There's nothing to configure — Apex detects what's installed on your system (pacman, apt, dnf, yay, paru, flatpak, snap) at runtime and only touches what's actually there.

## Usage

```
Usage: apex.sh [options]

  --no-pacman      Skip pacman even if present
  --no-apt         Skip apt even if present
  --no-dnf         Skip dnf even if present
  --no-aur         Skip AUR updates even if a helper is installed
  --no-flatpak     Skip flatpak updates
  --no-snap        Skip snap updates
  --no-notify      Don't send a desktop notification when finished
  --conservative   Wait for the AUR job to fully finish (not just its
                   initial download/resolve burst) before starting
                   flatpak/snap. Use this if the early-start detection
                   ever misbehaves for you.
  -h, --help       Show this help
```

You'll be prompted for your sudo password once, up front — Apex keeps the sudo timestamp alive in the background for the rest of the run so nothing prompts again mid-update.

## How it works

Apex runs in four stages:

**1. Download, one manager at a time.**
For every system package manager it finds (pacman, apt, dnf), Apex runs its "download-only" mode — nothing gets installed yet, packages just land in the local cache. This happens one manager at a time, in sequence, because these are the only steps guaranteed to compete for your bandwidth.

**2. Install + AUR build, all at once, in the background.**
The instant all downloads are done, every manager's real install step starts — reading straight from the cache that was just filled, so it's pure disk/CPU work. At the same moment, your AUR helper (`yay` or `paru`) starts resolving, cloning, and building AUR packages. None of this competes for bandwidth with anything else, so it all runs concurrently.

**3. flatpak, then snap — started as soon as it's safe.**
As soon as the AUR helper's upfront download burst is done and it's moved into actually compiling packages (see [below](#how-aur-timing-is-detected) for how that moment is detected), Apex starts flatpak, then snap, one after another — while the manager installs and the AUR build keep running in the background the whole time.

**4. Join everything, print a summary.**
Apex waits for every background job to finish, reports what succeeded/failed, and prints both how long the run actually took and how long the same work would have taken run strictly one step at a time.

## The strategy, in detail

The core insight is simple: **only downloads share a bottleneck (your internet connection).** Installing, unpacking, and compiling don't touch the network, so there's no reason to make them wait their turn.

```
        DOWNLOAD PHASE                  INSTALL/BUILD PHASE
        (serialized)                    (fully parallel)

pacman  [=====download=====]
apt                          [==dl==]
dnf                                   [====dl====]
                                                    │
                                                    ▼
                                    pacman install  [===]
                                    apt install         [==]
                                    dnf install             [====]
                                    AUR build               [==================]
                                                                        │
                                                            (AUR build-phase reached)
                                                                        ▼
                                                            flatpak    [====]
                                                            snap            [==]
```

Everything to the left of the vertical line only ever runs one thing at a time. Everything to the right runs concurrently, because none of it is network-bound (aside from flatpak/snap's own downloads, which is why they wait for the AUR download burst specifically, not the whole AUR job).

apt and dnf get the same download/install split pacman does:

- `apt-get -d dist-upgrade` — download only
- `dnf upgrade --downloadonly` — download only (needs the `download` plugin from `dnf-plugins-core`; usually preinstalled on Fedora — if it's missing, Apex logs it and falls back to a combined download+install for dnf instead of failing the whole run)

## How AUR timing is detected

There's no clean "download only" mode for AUR helpers the way there is for pacman/apt/dnf — `yay`/`paru` resolve dependencies, clone AUR repos, and build in one continuous run. So Apex needs another way to know when it's safe to start flatpak without stepping on AUR's own downloads.

The trick: both `yay` and `paru` shell out to the real `makepkg` binary to actually build packages, and makepkg's very first line of output for *any* package is always:

```
==> Making package: <name> <version> (<date>)
```

That line comes from makepkg itself — not from the AUR helper's own wrapper text — and its wording has been stable for years across both helpers. Apex captures the AUR helper's output (line-buffered, piped to a log file) and watches for the first occurrence of that line. Once it shows up, the big upfront burst — dependency resolution and cloning every outdated AUR package's repo — is done, and flatpak/snap are free to start.

To make sure that line is always in English (and therefore always matches), Apex forces `LC_ALL=C` on just that one subprocess — your shell's actual locale is untouched everywhere else.

This is a heuristic, not a guarantee:

- Per-package source downloads that happen *during* each individual build can still trickle in after this point. Those are usually small relative to compile time, so the residual bandwidth overlap is a reasonable trade-off.
- If the AUR job finishes before ever printing that line (nothing needed building, or it failed immediately), Apex notices the process has exited and moves on instead of waiting.
- A 20-minute safety timeout exists in case detection genuinely never triggers, so the script can't hang forever.
- If you don't trust any of this, `--conservative` disables it entirely — Apex will just wait for the whole AUR job to finish before starting flatpak/snap, trading some parallelism for certainty.

## Safety notes

- **AUR runs fully unattended.** To build AUR packages in the background without something silently blocking on a prompt, Apex passes `--noconfirm` plus the "auto-answer" flags (`--answerclean None --answerdiff None --answeredit None --answerupgrade All` for yay, `--skipreview` for paru). This means **you don't get to review PKGBUILD diffs before they build.** If reviewing AUR changes matters to you, do it separately and periodically (`yay -Pw`/similar) rather than relying on this script for that.
- **apt is forced noninteractive**, with `--force-confdef`/`--force-confold` so a config-file merge prompt can't hang the background job — when in doubt, it keeps your existing config file rather than the packaged default.
- **A theoretical pacman DB lock race exists.** A manager's install step and the AUR helper's own final `pacman -U` could, in principle, both want the pacman database lock at the same moment. In practice this essentially never happens — building AUR packages takes far longer than installing already-cached packages — but if you ever see `unable to lock database`, just re-run Apex.
- Nothing in Apex escalates privileges beyond what a normal manual update would need. `sudo` is requested once up front and kept alive via a background refresh loop; it isn't cached to disk or reused beyond the life of the script.

## Known limitations & concerns

- **The AUR-phase detection is a heuristic**, not something Apex can verify structurally (see above). It's designed to fail safe (falls through to "proceed anyway" rather than hanging), but it's inherently coupled to makepkg's current output format.
- **dnf's `--downloadonly` depends on a plugin** that isn't guaranteed to be installed. Apex handles its absence gracefully, but you won't get the pre-fetch benefit for dnf without `dnf-plugins-core`.
- **No interactive AUR review.** This is the main safety/speed trade-off in the whole design — see [Safety notes](#safety-notes).
- **The "time saved" percentage is inherently variable.** A run with a heavy AUR compile queue and light downloads will show much bigger savings than a run that's 90% downloading and 10% installing, because there's less overlap to exploit.
- Apex doesn't do any cleanup (`pacman -Sc`, `apt autoremove`, `dnf autoremove`, orphan removal, etc.) — it only updates. That's intentionally out of scope.

## Troubleshooting

**"unable to lock database"**
Two processes both reached for the pacman lock at once — see the note above. Just run Apex again.

**dnf download-only step fails immediately**
Install `dnf-plugins-core` (`sudo dnf install dnf-plugins-core`) if you want the pre-fetch benefit. Apex will still complete the update either way.

**apt seems to hang**
Shouldn't happen — `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` plus the forced dpkg options are meant to prevent this. If you do hit a hang, please open an issue with the package that triggered it.

**flatpak/snap started earlier than expected / later than expected**
That's the AUR-phase heuristic at work. Run with `--conservative` if you want deterministic (if slower) sequencing instead.
